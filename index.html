                <h3>UK Housing Prices are on the Rise</h3>
            </header>
            <main>
                <p>UK house prices in September increased by 3.2% compared with a year ago - the fastest rate for nearly two years, according to Nationwide. The UK housing crisis is markey by a shoortage of affordable homes, soaring property prices, and a decline in new housing constructive. Demand far outpaces supply, particulary in urban areas, pushing both renters and prospective buyers into a difficult market. Rising mortgages rates and inflation are also contributing to the strain, making it increasing challenging for first-time buyers to afford homes. The crisis is exacerbating social inequality, as many people struggle to secure stable and affordable housing.</p>

                <p>Based on the <a href="https://www.nationwidehousepriceindex.co.uk/reports" target="_blank"> building society's data</a> annual growth was the highest since November 2022, with terraced homes driving the increase. So these smaller properties have seen a resurgence in demand and this strong growth has driven the upturn in property prices in the same time period.</p>

                <p>It is said rising incomes and mortgage rate cuts were improving affordability for buyers. Seperate data from the Bank of England also showed mortgage approvals at their highest level for two years</p>

                <p>The average UK house price in September was £266,094, Nationwide said.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <cite>“Income growth has continued to outstrip house price growth in recent months while borrowing costs have edged lower amid expectations that the Bank of England will continue to lower interest rates in the coming quarters,” - said Nationwide's chief economist, Robert Gardner."</cite>
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>However, he said that while activity in the housing market and prices had picked up, they remained subdued compared with historical standards</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <cite>
                        "While sellers may be encouraged by these price rises, we find if a property is too highly priced, applicants don't waste their time and view." - Amy Reynolds
                    </cite>
                </blockquote>

                <h2>Chinese Investment: A Double-Edged Sword?</h2>
                <br>
                <img src="China.png" alt="Irish Minister Dara Calleary" style="width: 90vh; height:50vh; object-fit: cover; display: block; margin: 0 auto; border-radius: 0;">

                <h3>The impact of Chinese Investment on Ireland</h3>
            </header>
            <main>
                <p>Chinese investment in Ireland has had a profound impact on various sectors, including technology, manufacturing, and real estate. Ireland's strong ties with both the EU and the US make it an attractive destination for Chinese firms looking to expand into Western markets. Chinese companies have invested in technology hubs, real estate projects, and financial services, fostering job creation and economic growth in Ireland.</p>

                <p>In 2020, 25 Chinese companies had operations in the Republic of Ireland. By this year the number had <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/ireland-big-tech-china-economy/" target="_blank">jump to 40</a></p>

                <p>For some this new flood of yuan into the country offers Ireland an opportunity to reduce its reliance on being the European base for US tech giants such as Apple and Alphabet. And it creates additional jobs.</p>
                
                <p>But for an increasing number of critics, Ireland being home to Chinese firms links the country to the human rights abuse allegations levelled against some such companies. These include Chinese clothing firm Shein, which since May 2023 has had its European headquarters in Dublin.Shein has long been attacked for how the workers who makes its clothes are treated. And earlier this year it had to admit that it <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4glzzdd88lo" target="_blank">found child labour</a>in its supply chain.</p>

                <p>The Irish government is also in the diplomatically awkward position of luring many of the very Chinese companies that the US has sanctioned. Two cases in point - telecoms firm Huawei and drugs company WuXi Biologics</p>
